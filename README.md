# The Question Zone!

This program is a project created based on criteria given during my studies at Epicodus. This app allows for a series of questions to be pinned to a main question board area. The questions can be investigated and answered by users!

The board was done in the imagined theme that the characters from the podcast "The Adventure Zone" are answering the questions in the style of another podcast by the same creators called "My Brother, My Brother and Me."
